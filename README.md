# oneMonthLater.py
Predict 30 days after the last day in the dataset along with evaluation metrics table and graph to show model performance

eg: "Date: 2023-06-10, LSTM Prediction: 30292.11328125, GRU Prediction: 26160.421875, SimpleRNN Prediction: 29254.138671875"

# prediction.py
Predict the next day and create a model along with an evaluation metrics table and graph to show the model performance

# loop.py
It will run the model 10 times and show a fully detailed table for each run at the end it will save the best model based on RMSE
